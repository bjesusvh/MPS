# MPS
Multi-trait Parental Selection

Plant and animal breeders are interested in selecting the best individuals
    as parents in succesive selection cycles. `MPS` compute 
    Kullback-Leibler (kl), Energy Score (energy) and Multivariate 
    Asymmetric (malf) distances for every potential parent
    in a population to assist in multitrait selection.
